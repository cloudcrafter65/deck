**AI-Native Product Architect | CTO-Level Builder**

Singapore



------





## **Profile**





Hands-on technical product leader who designs **AI-first systems from first principles**. I operate at CTO depth but execute like a product entrepreneur — making architectural trade-offs, writing code, and shipping systems that materially improve outcomes.



Recently architected and built a **production GenAI platform** that reduced operational resolution time by **85%** by redesigning the system around automation, retrieval, and feedback loops rather than human workflows.



I specialise in **lean, outcome-driven architectures**: eliminating waste, minimising manual effort, and using AI as the operating system — not a feature layer.



------





## **What I Actually Do**





- Architect end-to-end systems where **AI replaces human decision loops**
- Make hard **build vs buy** calls grounded in speed, cost, and long-term leverage
- Design **adaptive, feedback-driven platforms** (signals → inference → action)
- Ship production systems personally (Python, GenAI, cloud)
- Optimise for **outcomes, not correctness theatre**

## **Selected Work (Relevant to This Role)**







### **AI-Native Product Architecture (2024–Present)**





**Principal & Acting CTO – Cyaire**



- Architected and built a **production GenAI RAG platform** (Python, LLMs, vector DBs, cloud-native)
- Reduced operational resolution time from ~7 days to **<24 hours (-85%)**
- Reframed the problem from “ticket automation” to **knowledge + decision automation**
- Designed system to adapt continuously via retrieval quality, confidence scoring, and feedback loops
- Personally made architectural trade-offs to prioritise **speed, simplicity, and leverage**





**Deliberate trade-off:**

Built a **custom integration broker** instead of buying an OOTB platform — faster to ship, lower cost, and better aligned with domain constraints than vendor abstractions.

### **CTO-Level Architecture & Product Judgment (2017–2024)**





**Cisco Systems – Regional Architecture & Product Influence (APAC)**



- Acted as **CTO-style technical owner** across multiple revenue-generating platforms
- Made architecture decisions affecting **$50M+ in direct bookings** and **$200M+ influenced revenue**
- Designed and scaled **feedback-driven systems** (AIOps, intent-based automation)
- Improved incident response outcomes by **~35%** through automation and signal-driven remediation
- Served as **field-to-product bridge**, shaping roadmap decisions based on real-world constraints





This was not roadmap theatre — it was architecture, trade-offs, and execution at scale.



------





## **How I Think (This Matters More Than Tools)**





- **AI is the system**, not an add-on
- Correctness is contextual; **speed and learning rate often matter more**
- Human effort is a liability unless it compounds insight
- If a system can’t adapt, it will stall
- Architecture is a business decision wearing a technical costume





------





## **Core Technical Capabilities**





- **GenAI systems:** RAG, agents, LLM orchestration, automation pipelines
- **Languages:** Python (primary), modern JS/TS
- **Cloud:** AWS (hands-on), multi-cloud architecture
- **Architecture:** Lean system design, integration patterns, platform trade-offs
- **AI usage:** Eliminating manual workflows, accelerating engineering, reducing cognitive load





------





## **What I’m Not**





- Not a roadmap-only product manager
- Not a people-heavy executive
- Not interested in meetings over outcomes
- Not attached to legacy education or enterprise models





------





## **Why This Role Makes Sense**





2 Hour Learning is rebuilding education by **rewriting the system**, not optimising the classroom.

That is exactly how I approach technology.
